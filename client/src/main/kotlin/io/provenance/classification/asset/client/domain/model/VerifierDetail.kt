/**
 * A configuration for a verifier's interactions with the Asset Classification smart contract.
 *
 * @param address The bech32 address of the verifier. A verifier application should have full access to this address in
 * order to execute the Asset Classification smart contract with this address as the signer.
 * @param onboardingCost A numeric representation of a specified coin amount to be taken during onboarding.  This value
 * will be distributed to the verifier and its fee destinations based on those configurations.
 * @param onboardingDenom The denomination of coin required for onboarding.  This value is used in tandem with
 * onboarding cost to determine a coin required.
 * @param feeDestinations A collection of addresses and fee distribution amounts that dictates how the fee amount is
 * distributed to other addresses than the verifier.  The amounts of all destinations should never sum to a value
 * greater than the onboarding cost.
 * @param entityDetail An optional set of fields defining the validator in a human-readable way.
