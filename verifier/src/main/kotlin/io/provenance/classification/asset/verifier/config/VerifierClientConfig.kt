/**
 * Configurations to tweak the behavior of the VerifierClient created with this class.
 *
 * @param acClient Allows communication with the asset classification smart contract.  Used for retrieved scope data
 * as well as sending verification messages.
 * @param verifierAccount The account that will submit verifications when assets are successfully retrieved.  This
 * account is also used with the default onboard and verify asset event helpers to ensure that only events pertaining
 * to this account are processed.
 * @param coroutineScope The scope used to dispatch asynchronous tasks, like event processing.
 * @param verificationProcessor A manually-defined class that will process incoming assets.
 * @param eventStreamNode The URI that tells the VerifierClient where to pick up events from the Provenance Blockchain.
 * @param streamRestartMode Defines what actions to take when the event stream fails.
 * @param verificationChannel The channel that VerificationMessage values are processed through.
 * @param eventChannel The channel that VerifierEvents are processed through.  This channel handles all messages emitted
 * via the client that are routed through the AssetClassificationEventDelegator.
 * @param eventDelegator Defines handlers for different event types emitted from the asset classification smart contract.
 * @param eventProcessors All manually-defined event handling code submitted during the builder process.  See the
 * VerifierEvent class for lengthy details about each.
